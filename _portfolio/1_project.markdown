	<h1 class="project-description-title">Problem</h1>
	<p>Uber’s rating system is flawed and it’s essential to fix since it since the company is dependent upon its peer to peer model. Through our research we found that the current Uber rating system promotes inflated and unreliable data, lack accountability and makes users afraid to rate low. </p>

<div class="post-content col three">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Concept</h1>
	<p>Our design aims to maintain the high perceived and actual quality of drivers. We did this through providing a greater distinction in ride quality. giving directed feedback to motivate higher quality and relieving the weight of a single scale.</p>

	<h1 class="project-description-title">What We Did</h1>
	<p>For this project we concentrated on defining the problem first and then sketching and generating ideas to help solve that problem.  Since the prompt was about rating scales, we also did much secondary research simultaneously on rating scales to get a better idea of which scales are most effective and why.<br><br>This team had no shortage of ideas but we had no way of evaluating which was best. The key insight for us was when we found Uber’s goals as stated by their data evangelist. This helped us redefine our problem space to match the priorities of the Uber company. From this key insight we were able to align our design the needs of our (fictional) client.</p>

<div class="post-content col two">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">What I Learned</h1>
	<p>Without a car I rely on Uber when public transportation is not available. As such I had a lot of opinions on this design and had to constantly remind myself to not design for me but for our users. Additionally, even if it’s a fictional client, I leaned the importance of understanding the company and designing specifically for that client.</p>
