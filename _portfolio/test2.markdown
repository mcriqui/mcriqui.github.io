	<p>View our final <a href="https://medium.com/interaction-design-practice/bloomington-firefighter-tool-design-49cf68e03492#.8a6nfmknv"><strong>Medium blog post here.</strong></a> I created this blog post witih input and edits from my team members.</p>

	<h1 class="project-description-title">Problem</h1>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/MDT.jpg">
	<p class="col two">The Mobile Data Terminal System, a laptop mounted in the passenger seat of the firetruck, has the potential to help firefighters but is insufficiently used. Using this device, we had to give firefighters the right information at the right time.  We were further constrained by the systems difficulty of use during a bumpy, fast paced ride and limited budget for technology.</p>
</div>

<div class="post-content col three">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Concept</h1>
	<p>We focused on giving firefighters the relevant information they need, when they actually need it. When firefighters arrive on scene, their instinct takes over. As such, we focused on preparing firefighters with accessible and relevant information while they are en route to the scene. In order to do so, we had to make the laptop easy to use while the truck is in motion. To do so, we broke down the keyboard into four quadrants making it easy for the user to quickly and efficiently toggle information on and off the screen. </p>

<div class="post-content">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">User Research</h1>
	<img class="col two" src="/img/fire_research.jpg">
	<p class="col one">To begin, we went to a local Bloomington firehouse and spent over two hours talking to firefighters about their work and lives. What started as a conversation about their desire for Iron Man suits and Google Glasses eventually turned into a rigorously honest conversation about themselves and their work. From this and follow up interviews, we were able to better understand them.</p>

<div class="post-content">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Sketching</h1>

	<p class="">From this research we narrowed down the problem and sketched continually. We sketched and we sketched, but couldn’t get it. Finally, we realized that we were iterating on the computer interface but what was really important was how firefighters use and interact with the system. Firefighters use the computer driving at high speeds in a huge truck so how feasible is it that they can use a track pad and control small buttons on the screen?</p>

	<h1 class="project-description-title">Iterating on What Matters</h1>
<!-- 	<img class="col three testing" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/fishbowl.jpg"/> -->
	<p>From this insight, we iterated on the keyboard and how the information is presented. Of course the information that’s displayed matters but they already have all the information at their disposal. What we were able to design and what was necessary to design was how they can easily access that information.</p>

		<h1 class="project-description-title">What I Learned</h1>
		<p>For this project we began framing the problem and iterating after we did the research. I learned that it’s important to start your process even before the research. Additionally, research should take place throughout the entire process, not just in the beginning.</p>
