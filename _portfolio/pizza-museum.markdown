	<h1 class="project-description-title">Prompt</h1>
	<p>We were tasked with creating an interative museum exhibt. Our exhbit needed to serve all relevant stakeholders and be viewed as innovative incorporating emerging technologies. We were able to explore different topics and choose one that we wanted to work on.</p>
</div>

<div class="post-content col three">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Exploring Topics</h1>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/firstpizzawhiteboard.jpg">
	<p class="col two">To begin, our team met and we discussed multiple topics. For a two month project we wanted to focus on something all team members were interested in. We each made a list of things and topics we are interested in. We then went to each other’s lists and 'plus-oned' those topics we would want to work on. There were three that we had the most interest: <a class="homepage_keywords">natural disasters, drugs and pizza.</a></p>
</div>

<div class="post-content col three">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Looking at Exemplars</h1>
	<p>To explore these  three topics, we looked at exemplars with each team member taking the lead on a topic. I looked for exemplars on the pizza topic and found interesting exemplars in other food museum exhibits, restaurants that have people making food in the windows and the first proclaimed pizza museum in Philadelphia. While these exemplars were good at showing the specific food, we wanted to delve deeper and not just show pizza to people but actually have them experience it.</p>

	<h1 class="project-description-title">Deciding on Pizza</h1>
	<p class="col two">After discussing all of our topics, pizza was the most compelling. We ran into ethical concerns with trying to get people to experience drugs and didn’t collectively feel strongly about natural disasters. We wanted to go one step further than the exhibits of our exemplars so we created an affinity diagram to explore what pizza really is and questions around pizza. Through our analysis we discovered that <a class="homepage_keywords">pizza brings people together. </a>Multiple people usually share a pie so we wanted to explore pizza as a means of bringing people together.</p>

<div class="post-content col three">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Sketching to Get to First Concept</h1>
	<p class="col three">With our goal of what we wanted the museum to do, we collectively sketched different ideas. Through round robin sketching and multiple iterations we came to a concept that we referred to as <a class="homepage_keywords">“Pizza as an Interface.”</a> We wanted to create a playful interaction so we sketched a pizza interface that would be on the floor. Users would come up to it and play different games that would teach them how to make a pizza and would also result in them creating an actual pizza to eat.<p>

</div>

<div class="post-content col three">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Experience Prototype</h1>
	<p class="col three">To conceptualize this idea we created an experience prototype. Under the direction of our appointed Art Director, Hannah Jones, we constructed a life size prototype. Creating the prototype and walking through the experience helped us find usability flaws but it also helped us think about if the concept was actually achieving our intended purpose of bringing people together.</p>

</div>

<div class="post-content">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Pastiche Scenario</h1>
	<p class="col three">To further evaluate our concept, our professor assigned us to create a pastiche scenario in which we created a fictional story about a well-realized character interacting with our design. I wrote my story using Parks and Recreation character Leslie Knope. Through writing the story and discussing my other teammates stories, we realized that our pizza as an interface was a very individual experience yet people often come to museums with other people. As such, the <a class="homepage_keywords">interface wasn’t bringing people together but instead driving them apart</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="post-content">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Critical Design</h1>
	<p class="col three">Our professor assigned another project to create a critical design around our exhibit. Going off of our major insight from the pastiche scenario, we wanted to create a critical design that questions how families eat dinner together. We created a pizza box that detects how many phones are connected to the wifi and will only open if all of the phones are placed in the box. It’s a play on eating because the box eats the phones. You can watch our video that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-nhxoeiFTg" target="_blank"><strong>portrays the design here.</strong></a></p>
	<div class="img_row">
		<img class="col three" src="/img/criticaldesign.jpg">	
	</div>
	<p class="col three">This critical design was essential for our group because it helped us further explore what bringing people together, specifically families, means. Do families have to talk and interact with one another while they’re together or is silent companionship enough to bring families together? While our final concept went in a different direction, this was an important avenue to go down because it helped us think beyond pizza and get at the core of our exhibit.</p>

<div class="post-content">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Sketching to Get to Final Concept</h1>	
	<img class="col one" src="/img/pizzasketching1.jpg">
	<p class="col two">With our new insights, we quite literally went back to the drawing board. Through sketching and iterating we came to our final concept of <a class="homepage_keywords">an exhibit that’s a game.</a> Families would split into teams and then compete in five games that would allow them to play while learning about pizza. We researched play and how it's important for the development of children and important for family bonding so we wanted to use our exhibit to encourage play with family members. Meals are often times when families come together so food, specifically pizza, made sense to connect with this goal.</p>

<div class="post-content">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">Prototyping</h1>
	<p class="col three">To create our final deliverable, we engaged in many hours of arts and crafts. Careful attention to detail while cutting out tomatoes, taping paper together and spray painting a plastic container paid off when we were able to see our final design realized. When we began this project I told a classmate that I’m not the biggest museum fan. His response to me was,<a class="homepage_keywords"> “Build one you would want to visit.” </a>Looking at our final design, this is absolutely an exhibit that I would want to visit.</p>

<div class="post-content">
	<h1 class="project-description-title">What I learned</h1>
	
	<p class="col three">During this project our professor encouraged and assigned projects to disrupt our ‘usual’ process. Doing activities like pastiche scenarios and critical design was helpful for us and pushed us to go beyond our first concept and really get at the core of our exhibit. Additionally, this was the first project where we actually built many prototypes. The physically of our concepts was extremely helpful in conceptualizing them and evaluating, not to mention that building things like a giant cheese grater is fun!</p>
