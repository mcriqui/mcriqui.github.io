<br/>
I am currently a first year Master’s student in Indiana University’s <a class="homepage_keywords">Human Computer Interaction Design</a> program. Before attending IU, I worked for <a class="homepage_keywords">IBM</a> at a center called the <a class="homepage_keywords">Institute for Electronic Government</a>. I received my undergraduate degree from George Washington Unviersity in <a class="homepage_keywords">International Affairs</a>. 

On the side, I'm a memeber of IU’s <a class="homepage_keywords">PIT (Promoting Inclusivity in Tech) Crew</a> which strives to make the school more inclusive for all students. I am an active but remote member of <a class="homepage_keywords">Hear Me Code</a>, a Washington, DC based group offering free beginner friendly Python classes to women. Through my study of <a class="homepage_keywords">Python</a> I’ve worked on some fun projects around DC Metro data, fantasy basketball and Guy Fieri.
