	<p>Promoting Inclusivity in Technology (PIT) is a student-led organization whose goal is to promote inclusivity at the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC) at Indiana University. PIT creates and delivers workshops to students, Associate Instructors and staff. These workshops discuss the topics of uncovering unconscious bias, micro-aggressions and micro-inequities. Through these workshops we equip participants with the knowledge and tools to make the school a more inclusive environment.</p>

We will study the role of male advocates for gender equity in academia and host a university wide campaign to promote male advocates. I am personally co-managing a competition for students to 	share their stories about gender equity.</p>
