<h1 class="project-description-title">Yelp Analysis of Restaurants on Diner's Drive-Ins Dives</h1>

<p>Did you know that the average Yelp rating of a restaurant that Guy Fieri vists on his show Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives is 3.80? If you haven't visited my project's website about this subject, I bet you didn't!<p> 


<div class="img_row ddd_align">
	<p class="col one">Using Python, I accessed all of the Yelp ratings for the restaurants on Guy's show with the Yelp API. I then color coded them according to the number of stars and mapped them using Githubs mapping geoJSON feature.<br><br><a class="ddd_project_site" href="http://maggiecriqui.com/yelp-DDD/"><strong> Check it out here!</strong></a></p>
