	<p class="col one">A friend and I created an alarm clock that runs a Python script on a Raspberry Pi. The time adjusts basded on two open data APIs: DC Metro and the Office of Personnel Management. If there's a Metro delay, the time adjusts to wake the user up earlier. In DC, many organizations follow the Federal Government's operating status, so if there is a two hour delay, the alarm will wake the user up two hours later and if the Fed is closed, it will turn the alarm off.<br><br><a class="ddd_project_site" href="https://github.com/mcriqui/s_thing"><strong> The script lives here!</strong></a></p>
